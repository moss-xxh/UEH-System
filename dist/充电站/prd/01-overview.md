# Charging Station SaaS System - Overview

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
* Deliver a multi-tenant SaaS platform for electric vehicle charging network operators.
* Provide a white-labeled management portal for charging companies (tenants).
* Offer a white-labeled mobile app for end-users (drivers) to manage charging.
* Achieve 99.9% platform uptime.
* Onboard 10 charging companies within the first year of operation.

### Background Context
Currently, charging network companies often rely on fragmented, expensive, and non-scalable custom software to manage their charging stations. This operational inefficiency hinders their ability to grow and provides a disjointed experience for EV drivers. This PRD outlines a unified, three-tiered SaaS platform designed to solve this problem by providing a centralized management solution for operators and a seamless charging experience for their customers.
