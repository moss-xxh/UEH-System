# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The user experience should be clean, intuitive, and efficient. For charging company operators, the portal's design will prioritize clarity, providing quick access to management tasks and essential data. For EV drivers, the mobile app will focus on simplicity and speed, making the process of finding a station and starting a charge as seamless as possible.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
* **SaaS & Admin Portals:** A dashboard-centric design will serve as the homepage, offering at-a-glance insights. Management of stations, chargers, and users will be handled through clear, data-rich tables with robust filtering and search capabilities.
* **Mobile App:** The app will feature a map-first interface as the primary screen, allowing users to instantly locate nearby charging stations. The charging process will be initiated via a prominent, easily accessible QR code scanning function.

## Core Screens and Views

### Admin Portal:
* Tenant (Company) List
* Tenant Detail & Management View

### SaaS Company Portal:
* Main Dashboard (Key metrics)
* Stations Management (List and map views)
* Charger Detail Page
* Charging Sessions History

### Mobile App:
* Map View (Home Screen)
* Station Detail Page (Available chargers, pricing)
* QR Code Scanner
* Active Charging Session Screen
* User Profile & Charging History

## Accessibility
* The product will adhere to **WCAG AA** standards to ensure it is usable by people with a wide range of disabilities.

## Branding
* As a white-labeled product, the design will be brand-agnostic and minimalist, using a neutral color palette. The system will be designed to allow tenants to easily customize it with their own logo and primary brand color.

## Target Device and Platforms
* **Web Responsive** for the Admin and SaaS portals, ensuring usability on both desktop and tablet devices.
* **iOS & Android** for the end-user mobile application.
