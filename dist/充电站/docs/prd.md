# Charging Station SaaS System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Goals and Background Context
**Goals**
* Deliver a multi-tenant SaaS platform for electric vehicle charging network operators.
* Provide a white-labeled management portal for charging companies (tenants).
* Offer a white-labeled mobile app for end-users (drivers) to manage charging.
* Achieve 99.9% platform uptime.
* Onboard 10 charging companies within the first year of operation.

**Background Context**
Currently, charging network companies often rely on fragmented, expensive, and non-scalable custom software to manage their charging stations. This operational inefficiency hinders their ability to grow and provides a disjointed experience for EV drivers. This PRD outlines a unified, three-tiered SaaS platform designed to solve this problem by providing a centralized management solution for operators and a seamless charging experience for their customers.

### User Interface Design Goals

#### Overall UX Vision
The user experience should be clean, intuitive, and efficient. For charging company operators, the portal's design will prioritize clarity, providing quick access to management tasks and essential data. For EV drivers, the mobile app will focus on simplicity and speed, making the process of finding a station and starting a charge as seamless as possible.

#### Key Interaction Paradigms
* **SaaS & Admin Portals:** A dashboard-centric design will serve as the homepage, offering at-a-glance insights. Management of stations, chargers, and users will be handled through clear, data-rich tables with robust filtering and search capabilities.
* **Mobile App:** The app will feature a map-first interface as the primary screen, allowing users to instantly locate nearby charging stations. The charging process will be initiated via a prominent, easily accessible QR code scanning function.

#### Core Screens and Views
* **Admin Portal:**
    * Tenant (Company) List
    * Tenant Detail & Management View
* **SaaS Company Portal:**
    * Main Dashboard (Key metrics)
    * Stations Management (List and map views)
    * Charger Detail Page
    * Charging Sessions History
* **Mobile App:**
    * Map View (Home Screen)
    * Station Detail Page (Available chargers, pricing)
    * QR Code Scanner
    * Active Charging Session Screen
    * User Profile & Charging History

#### Accessibility
* The product will adhere to **WCAG AA** standards to ensure it is usable by people with a wide range of disabilities.

#### Branding
* As a white-labeled product, the design will be brand-agnostic and minimalist, using a neutral color palette. The system will be designed to allow tenants to easily customize it with their own logo and primary brand color.

#### Target Device and Platforms
* **Web Responsive** for the Admin and SaaS portals, ensuring usability on both desktop and tablet devices.
* **iOS & Android** for the end-user mobile application.

### Technical Assumptions

#### Repository Structure: Monorepo
* We will use a single monorepo to house the code for the web portals, the mobile app, and the backend services.
* **Rationale:** This approach simplifies code sharing (e.g., for data types between frontend and backend), streamlines dependency management, and makes cross-platform changes easier to coordinate.

#### Service Architecture: Serverless
* The backend will be built using a serverless architecture, leveraging cloud functions (e.g., AWS Lambda).
* **Rationale:** A serverless approach is cost-effective (pay-per-use), scales automatically to handle fluctuating demand, and reduces infrastructure management overhead, which is ideal for an MVP.

#### Testing Requirements: Full Testing Pyramid
* We will implement a comprehensive testing strategy including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end (E2E) tests.
* **Rationale:** This ensures code quality, reduces regressions, and provides confidence in the application's stability, which is critical for a system handling payments and real-world hardware.

#### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
* **Frontend (Web Portals):** React with the Next.js framework. (Works seamlessly with Chakra UI and serverless deployments).
* **Mobile App:** React Native. (Allows for code sharing with the React-based web portals).
* **Backend:** Node.js with TypeScript, using the NestJS framework. (Provides a structured, scalable architecture for building APIs).
* **Database:** PostgreSQL. (A powerful and reliable open-source relational database that handles multi-tenancy well).
* **Deployment:** Vercel for the Next.js frontend and AWS for backend services (Lambda, API Gateway, RDS for PostgreSQL).
* **Charger Integration:** The platform will initially support the OCPP 1.6J protocol for communication with charging hardware.
