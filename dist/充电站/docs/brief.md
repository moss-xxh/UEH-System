# Project Brief: 充电站管理系统 (EV Charging Station Management System)

## Executive Summary

**Product Concept:** A comprehensive SaaS platform for managing electric vehicle charging infrastructure, enabling charging station companies to efficiently operate, monitor, and monetize their charging networks through a centralized management system and user-facing mobile application.

**Primary Problem:** Charging station operators lack unified, scalable solutions to manage multi-site operations, resulting in inefficient resource utilization, poor user experience, and limited visibility into operational performance across their charging networks.

**Target Market:** Electric vehicle charging station operators managing multiple locations, from small regional operators (5-20 stations) to large national networks (100+ stations), who need enterprise-grade management capabilities with multi-tenant support.

**Key Value Proposition:** Deliver a scalable, multi-tenant SaaS platform that centralizes charging station operations, optimizes utilization rates, enhances user experience, and provides real-time analytics—all while reducing operational costs by up to 40% through automation and intelligent management.
